## Hey, I'm driz. I'm a teammember of LinuxServer.io, an IT Consultant for the DoD, and I love technology.

### I’m currently working on:  
  * Migrating from DNSMASQ for DHCP/DNS to redundant kea-dhcp nodes (on hold because i lost interest)
  * prepping to move from 10Gbps to 40Gbps in my home network (why not at these low prices?)
  * Current network overview
    * 20Gbps port channels from access switches to the collapsed core switch  
    * 10Gbps to my desktop  
    * 20Gbps port channels to the servers  
    * 10Gbps from the core switch to the WAN edge
  * I just passed the Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate (KCNA) exam and will likely work on CKA and CKAD next!
  * I'm due to renew my Cisco certifications in May, but there is a revamp in February, so I'm taking the easy route and doing it before February!
### I’m currently learning:  
  * Ribbon Communications' suite of applications  
  * Oracle SBC (for work)
  * Cisco ASAv (for work)
  * Microsoft SQL Server clustering (for work)
  * Juniper (for work) using the Cisco path to JNCIP
### Ask me about:

### Fun facts:  
1. I was a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne Division and have had multiple combat deployments

3. I have been using Linux since 1996
    * I started with Slackware 3.1  
    * I changed to LFS in 2002 to get the most out of my gaming pc  
    * I swapped to CentOS for a while due to work reasons  
    * I swapped mostly to debian in 2014 out of sheer laziness
4. I got in to VoIP in 2002 to split a single POTS phone line between my college roommate and myself
    * I made the mistake of using TTS using a highly sexualized voice for our recordings... it resulted in a LOT of calls and voicemails that were very odd
