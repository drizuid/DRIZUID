### Hey, I'm driz.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
    Upgrading my primary PC and prepping to move from 10Gbps to 40Gbps in my home (why not?)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
    Ribbon Communications' suite of applications and hoping to work time for learning K8s into my schedule
- 💬 Ask me about:
    VoIP, networking, home automation, docker
- 📫 How to reach me: 
    Probably easiest on the linuxserver.io discord
- ⚡ Fun facts:
    I was a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne Division and have travelled the world
    I have been using Linux since 1996 when I started with Slackware 3.1
      I changed to LFS in 2002 to get the most out of my gaming pc
      I swapped to CentOS for a while due to work reasons
      I swapped mostly to debian in 2014 out of sheer laziness
