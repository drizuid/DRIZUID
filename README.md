## Hey, I'm driz. There probably is not much of interest here!

### I’m currently working on:  
Upgrading my primary PC and prepping to move from 10Gbps to 40Gbps in my home (why not?)
### I’m currently learning:  
Ribbon Communications' suite of applications and hoping to work time for learning K8s into my schedule
### Ask me about:  
VoIP, networking, home automation, docker, gaming, linux, and more...
### How to reach me:   
Probably easiest on the Linuxserver.io Discord

### Fun facts:  
1. I was a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne Division and have traveled the world  
2. I have been using Linux since 1996
    * I started with Slackware 3.1  
    * I changed to LFS in 2002 to get the most out of my gaming pc  
    * I swapped to CentOS for a while due to work reasons  
    * I swapped mostly to debian in 2014 out of sheer laziness
