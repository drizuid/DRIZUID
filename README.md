2. I have been using Linux since 1996
    * I started with Slackware 3.1  
    * I changed to LFS in 2002 to get the most out of my gaming pc  
    * I swapped to CentOS for a while due to work reasons  
    * I swapped mostly to debian in 2014 out of sheer laziness
3. I got in to VoIP in 2002 to split a single POTS phone line between my college roommate and myself
    * I made the mistake of using TTS using a highly sexualized voice for our recordings... it resulted in a LOT of calls and voicemails that were very odd

      * I provide service to my home
      * my parents home in another state
